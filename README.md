## Introduction

EEZ Studio is a free and open source cross-platform low-code visual tool for desktop and embedded GUIs with [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/) support. Built-in _EEZ Flow_ enables the creation of complex scenarios for test and measurement automation, and the Instruments feature offers remote control of multiple devices and T&M equipment including [EEZ BB3](https://github.com/eez-open/modular-psu) T&M chassis and [EEZ H24005](https://github.com/eez-open/psu-hw) programmable power supply and any other T&M devices that support [SCPI](https://www.ivifoundation.org/scpi/) from manufacturers such as Keysight, Rigol, Siglent, etc.

## Installation

64-bit OS is required in all cases.

### Linux

Depending on your linux distribution, choose one of the listed packages (.deb, .rpm) and start the installation using the associated installer.
In addition, there is a self-executing .AppImage version that, after downloading, needs to enable the `Allow executing file as program` under file `Permissions` before starting it.
If you encounter a problem running the .AppImage version on your Linux distribution, try running it using the `--no-sandbox` option, i.e. `./EEZ-Studio-[version].AppImage --no-sandbox`

### Mac

Download `eezstudio-mac.zip`, unpack and move `eezstudio.app` to Applications.

### Windows

Download and start `EEZ_Studio_setup.exe`.

### Nix

The Nix flake provides a derivation for EEZ Studio or an overlay
that provides that derivation. It can be used to install the project using
[Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/).

### Build and run from source (all operating systems)

-   Install `Node.JS 16.x` or newer
-   Install `node-gyp`, more information at https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation

#### Only Linux:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libudev-dev libnss3
```

#### Only Raspbian:

Install Node.js 16 and npm on Raspberry Pi: https://lindevs.com/install-node-js-and-npm-on-raspberry-pi/

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libudev-dev libopenjp2-tools ruby-full
sudo gem install fpm
```

#### All platforms:

```
git clone https://github.com/eez-open/studio
cd studio
npm install
npm run build
```

Start with:

```
npm start
```

Create distribution packages (except MacOS and Raspbian):

```
npm run dist
```

On MacOS:

```
npm run dist-mac-arm64
```

or

```
npm run dist-mac-x64
```

On Raspbian:

```
npm run dist-raspbian
```

#### Nix

To build:

```
nix build 'github:eez-open/studio'
```

To start:

```
nix run 'github:eez-open/studio'
```

## USB TMC

The USB TMC driver must be installed if you want to access the T&M instrument using the USB-TMC interface from EEZ Studio _Instrument_ section.

### Windows

Download and start [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie/). Select your device, select libusb-win32 and press "Replace Driver" button:

![Zadig](docs/images/usbtmc_zadin_windows.png)

### Linux

You will probably need to add your Linux account to the usbtmc group before you can access the instrument using EEZ Studio. Connect your instrument with a USB cable and turn it on. Wait until booting is complete. Now check the instrument group name by entering the following command:

```
ls -l /dev/usbtmc*
```

In case it is root, enter the command:

```
sudo groupadd usbtmc
```

Now, add your account (<username>) to the group:

```
sudo usermod -a -G usbtmc <username>
```

A reboot is required. After that, the gid of `/dev/usbtmc0` should be set to `usbtmc` and
you are ready to use your instrument via USB-TMC interface.

## FAQ

[Q&A Wiki](https://github.com/eez-open/studio/wiki/Q&A)

**Q**: Where is the database file by default?
**A**: Depending on the operating system, it can be:

-   Linux: `~/.config/eezstudio/storage.db`
-   Mac: `~/Library/Application\ Support/eezstudio/storage.db`
-   Windows: `%appdata%\eezstudio\storage.db`

The default created database as well as its location can be changed later through the options in the _Settings_ section of EEZ Studio.

**Q**: Where are the IEXTs (Instrument EXTensions) used to access T&M instruments stored?
**A**: Depending on the operating system, it can be:

-   Linux: `~/.config/eezstudio/extensions`
-   Mac: `~/Library/Application\ Support/eezstudio/extensions`
-   Windows: `%appdata%\eezstudio\extensions`
